## Prediction

After the model is created with the build excel model option, you select the location where you will save the excel model from the dialog that appears.

You open the saved excel model and make predictions for the column you want. In this example, the target column was revenue and when we filled the temperature column with different values, the revenue column was filled with the predicted values.
