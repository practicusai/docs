# Tutorials

Practicus AI offers two primary types of tutorials—one designed for technical users who prefer to code and another suited for those who don’t code, using AI Studio’s more intuitive, no-code/low-code capabilities.

## Technical Tutorial

You can start by reading the technical tutorial right here in the documentation—simply open the **"Technical Tutorial"** section from the menu. 

### Hands-on coding experience (recommended)

If you’d like a hands-on experience, follow these steps to run the tutorial notebooks in your Practicus AI environment:

1. **Access Practicus AI Home:**  
   Navigate to Practicus AI Home (e.g., `https://practicus.your-company.com`).

2. **Create a Worker (Kubernetes Pod):**  
   Select your container image, resource configurations (CPU, memory, GPU), and any additional features you need.

3. **Open Jupyter Lab or VS Code:**  
   Once the Worker is ready, launch Jupyter Lab or VS Code to start working in a fully interactive coding environment.

4. **View the `samples/notebooks` Directory:**  
   Here you’ll find the tutorial notebooks that **match exactly to what you’ve read in the technical tutorial**, allowing you to execute code, experiment with data, and deepen your understanding through real-world practice.

## AI Studio Tutorial

If coding isn’t your focus, the AI Studio tutorial is ideal:

- **Offline Mode:**  
  Download AI Studio and explore its offline features for a no-code/low-code experience. You can visualize data, build simple models, and try out intuitive tools without needing a Practicus AI service connection.

- **Online Mode:**  
  For more advanced workflows and additional datasets, connect AI Studio to a Practicus AI service. This will unlock the full potential of real-time data access, model deployments, and integrated analytics, all without writing a line of code.
