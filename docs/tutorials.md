# Tutorials

Practicus AI offers two primary types of tutorials—one designed for technical users who prefer to code and another suited for those who don’t code, using AI Studio’s more intuitive, no-code/low-code capabilities.

## Technical Tutorial (if you code)

You can start by reading the technical tutorial right here in the documentation—simply open the [Technical Tutorial](notebooks/01_getting_started/01_introduction.md)

### For a hands-on coding experience (recommended)

If you’d like a hands-on experience, follow these steps to run the tutorial notebooks in your Practicus AI environment:

1. **Create a Worker:**  
   From Practicus AI Home, create a Worker.
   
2. **Open Jupyter Lab or VS Code:**  
   Open Jupyter Lab or VS Code on the worker you just created.

3. **View the `samples/notebooks` Directory:**  
   Here you’ll find the tutorial notebooks that **match** exactly to what you read in the technical tutorial.

## AI Studio Tutorial (if you do not code)

If coding isn’t your focus, the [AI Studio tutorial](tutorial/start.md) is ideal:

1. **Access Practicus AI Studio or Workspaces:**  
   From Practicus AI Home, open a browser-based Workspace or [download AI Studio](https://practicus.ai/download/). 

2. **Follow the tutorial steps**  
   Open [AI Studio tutorial](tutorial/start.md) and start following the tutorial steps.
