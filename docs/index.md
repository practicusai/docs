## Add-Ons

In addition to the core platform, Practicus AI offer a variety of add-ons that can be selectively incorporated into your environment. These add-ons are **protected by enterprise single sign-on** and **integrate smoothly with core platform and other add-on components**. As we continue to expand the add-on library, you’ll have access to a growing range of tools and features, ensuring that your platform remains both adaptable and secure as your AI initiatives evolve.

## Practicus AI's Core Principles

While the core platform and its add-ons define what you can accomplish with Practicus AI, a set of **guiding principles** ensures that every feature, integration, and improvement remains aligned with our core values of security, flexibility, and usability.

### 7 Core Principles of the Practicus AI Platform

1. **Security & Compliance First:**  
   The platform must maintain enterprise-level security and compliance at all times, enforcing measures such as SSO with MFA/OTP and strict data governance to safeguard sensitive information.

2. **Cloud-Native & Vendor-Agnostic:**  
   The platform must remain cloud-native and adhere to open-source and CNCF standards, ensuring it can be deployed in any environment—on-premises, in the cloud, or within air-gapped configurations—without creating vendor lock-in.

3. **Ease of Use & Extensibility:**  
   The platform must provide a unified interface that simplifies setup, enables rapid deployment, and supports extensibility, adapting smoothly to evolving requirements.

4. **Operational Simplicity for Technical Teams:**  
   The platform must reduce operational complexity, allowing technical users to focus on designing and refining AI solutions rather than managing infrastructure overhead.

5. **Real-Time Observability & Scalability:**  
   The platform must offer continuous insights into performance and health, alongside automatic scaling and optimized GPU utilization, ensuring efficiency as workloads grow.

6. **Accessibility for Non-Technical Users:**  
   The platform must deliver interfaces and tools that are easy to navigate, allowing non-technical users to engage in data exploration, analysis, and insight generation without requiring advanced expertise.

7. **Comprehensive Analytics & Generative AI:**  
   The platform must integrate a full spectrum of analytics capabilities, from traditional to advanced and generative AI, supporting informed decision-making and fostering innovation across diverse use cases.
