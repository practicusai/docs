## Optional - Using your limited SaaS account

Since we are allocating our online resources to production workloads, your SaaS account is limited to online features such as **GPT**, but **not** Cloud Workers. 

For features such as AutoML, please use Cloud Workers on local containers or AWS marketplace.

### Sample Data Exploration view, utilizing cost-effective options

### Using GPT and other "online only" features with your limited SaaS

When you use the App + local container or AWS marketplace option, the App intelligently decides when an "online only" feature such as GPT is required to use the SaaS. 

By combining local container or AWS marketplace with the limited SaaS, you will be able to trial all features with **no limitations**, and in a **cost-effective** way. 

### Unlimited SaaS option

If you prefer to use our SaaS unlimited, please [click here to start Practicus AI SaaS trial](https://practicus.ai/cloud/#saas)
