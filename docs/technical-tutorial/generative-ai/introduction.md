# Generative AI with Practicus AI

Generative AI (GenAI) is revolutionizing how we interact with and utilize AI models, enabling applications that can generate text, answer questions, and provide intelligent, human-like responses. Practicus AI provides a streamlined and powerful platform to build, deploy, and scale Generative AI workflows and applications. This section of the tutorial focuses on leveraging Practicus AI for cutting-edge GenAI use cases.

## Key Areas of Focus

### Building Visual Applications for GenAI
With Practicus AI, you can create visually rich, interactive applications that leverage GenAI capabilities. You can integrate Generative AI models into applications to provide functionalities such as:

- Chatbots for customer service or technical support.
- Creative content generators for marketing or entertainment.
- Educational tools that dynamically respond to user inputs.

These applications are easy to deploy and scale using Practicus AI's infrastructure, ensuring smooth performance and seamless user experience.

### Building Flows with LangChain
LangChain is a framework designed to build **sequential chains of prompts and actions** that utilize large language models (LLMs). Practicus AI integrates seamlessly with LangChain including private LLM endpoints to enable the following:

- **Chains**: Create chains of prompts that interact with LLMs, memory, or tools.
- **Tools and Agents**: Use LangChain's built-in tools to interact with APIs or databases. Build agents that intelligently choose which actions to take.
- **Memory**: Add memory to your LLM applications, enabling context-aware interactions that persist across conversations.
  
By combining LangChain's rich abstraction with Practicus AI's scalable execution environment, you can build sophisticated, dynamic AI-driven workflows.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vector Databases
RAG enhances GenAI applications by combining the power of LLMs with the precision of vector search. Practicus AI supports RAG workflows by:

- Integrating with vector databases to perform semantic search.
- Using your domain-specific data for fine-tuned, accurate responses.
- Combining LLM capabilities with real-time document retrieval for high-quality, contextually relevant outputs.

This approach is ideal for creating chatbots, document assistants, and any application requiring up-to-date and context-aware AI-generated responses.

### Deploying Custom GenAI Models
Practicus AI enables you to deploy custom fine-tuned LLMs tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're building models for healthcare, finance, or creative tasks, the platform supports:

- **Fine-Tuning**: Train custom models using Practicus AI's distributed computing capabilities, leveraging frameworks like **DeepSpeed** and **FairScale**.
- **Deployment**: Host your fine-tuned LLMs with auto-scaling, secure endpoints, and service mesh integration.
- **Integration**: Connect your custom models to your applications, workflows, and APIs, ensuring seamless access.
