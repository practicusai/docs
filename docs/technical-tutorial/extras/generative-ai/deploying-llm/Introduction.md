# LLM Deployment Tutorial

##### Welcome to the LLM Deployment Tutorial. This guide is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) and creating API endpoints tailored to various use cases. The tutorial is divided into three sections, each addressing a specific deployment scenario. By following these steps, you will learn both foundational and advanced deployment techniques, including integration with PracticusAI's powerful SDK for enhanced functionality.

#### Preparation

##### Before deploying an LLM, it is essential to prepare the model and its environment. This section outlines the steps for downloading an open-source LLM from Hugging Face and uploading it to an object storage system. This preparation is critical, as the model host service will download the LLM from object storage when running for the first time. 

#### Basic LLM Deployment

##### In this section, we will explore how to deploy an open-source LLM and create an API endpoint using only the Transformers library. This straightforward approach is ideal for scenarios where a standalone LLM API is needed without the additional complexity of pipeline integrations or dependencies on the PracticusAI SDK. By the end of this section, you will have:

##### - A deployed open-source LLM.

##### - A functional API endpoint to interact with the model.

##### - Insights into managing a basic deployment workflow.

##### While this setup is not designed for LangChain compatibility, it serves as a foundational building block for standalone applications.

#### LangChain-Suitable LLM Deployment

##### This section focuses on deploying an LLM and creating an API endpoint that integrates seamlessly with LangChain pipelines. Leveraging the PracticusAI SDK, this method provides advanced functionality and ensures compatibility with LangChain operations. Key SDK methods you will learn include:

##### - PrtLangMessage: Structuring communication flows with the hosted LLM.

##### - PrtLangRequest: Sending structured messages to the LLM and requesting a response.

##### - PrtLangResponse: Parsing and interpreting the responses from the LLM.

##### - ChatPracticus: A comprehensive method that simplifies the entire interaction process for LangChain integration.

##### By the end of this section, you will have:

##### - A fully deployed LLM API endpoint.

##### - Compatibility with LangChain pipelines.

##### - Practical knowledge of using the PracticusAI SDK to enhance deployment.

#### Combined Usage

##### In the final section, we bring together the methods covered in the previous sections. This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to combine the Basic LLM Deployment and LangChain-Suitable LLM Deployment approaches to create versatile API endpoints. Whether you need standalone functionality or seamless integration with LangChain, this section will equip you with the skills to:

##### - Transition between basic and advanced deployments.

##### - Combine deployment strategies for maximum flexibility.

##### - Optimize workflows for diverse application requirements.

##### By completing this tutorial, you will gain a deep understanding of LLM deployment techniques and how to leverage PracticusAI SDK for enhanced functionality and integration.
